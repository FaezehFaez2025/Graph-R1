The stream flows south and about five miles south of its headwaters the stream becomes the boundary between Boone and Callaway counties.  The stream crosses under Interstate 70 about eight miles east of Columbia and enters the Mark Twain National Forest.  The stream flows south to southwest through the national forest and upon leaving the forest turns to the east and ceases to be the county line.  The stream flows east for about one mile then turns south and flows under U. S. Route 63 and into the Missouri River four miles northwest of Cedar City and across the river from Jefferson City.

            "Emo is a genre of rock music characterized by an emphasis on emotional expression, sometimes through confessional lyrics.  It emerged as a style of post-hardcore from the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as emotional hardcore or emocore and pioneered by Washington, D.C. hardcore bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace.  However, as the genre was taken up by a new generation of musicians in the early 1990s, its sound and meaning shifted and changed and it was reinvented as a style of indie rock and pop punk by bands such as Jawbreaker, Sunny Day Real Estate, Weezer, and Jimmy Eat World.  By the mid-1990s, numerous emo acts such as Braid, The Promise Ring, and the Get Up Kids emerged in the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the genre.  Meanwhile, a more aggressive style of emo, screamo, had also emerged, pioneered by the San Diego bands Heroin and Antioch Arrow.",

The style, a counterpart of indie rock, differs to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free than other indie rock.  In later years, the definition of \"indie pop\" has bifurcated to also mean bands from unrelated DIY scenes/movements with pop leanings.  Subgenres include chamber pop and twee pop.",

Nicholas Delffs joined soon after on vocals and guitar.  They spent the next three years gradually building a following in the Portland area and self-releasing two CDs, one informally called \"The Skidmore Days\", which is a lo-fi full-length album recorded in future guitarist Jeff Lehman's North Portland basement and mixed by Alex Arrowsmith.  They also released a self-titled EP informally referred to as the \"Bonnie Doon EP\", in reference to the location it was recorded.  The Shaky Hands were signed to Holocene Music in late 2006.

Nathan Delffs (Nicholas' brother, and member of The Castanets) joined shortly thereafter on percussion and lap steel.  Their sound is a fusion of 1960s style British Invasion bands such as The Kinks, The Who and The Zombies and American folk-rock in the vein of Neil Young.  The result is what many have described as a loose, jangly, rootsy style of indie rock.

By the late 1960s, a number of identifiable rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, and jazz-rock fusion, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock influenced by the counter-cultural psychedelic scene.  New genres that emerged from this scene included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring major subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed.  In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw, energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques.  Punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres, including new wave, post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement.  From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock.

As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, indie identified those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective.  In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term."

Mobile Bay is the fourth largest estuary in the United States with a discharge of 62000 cuft of water per second.  Annually, and often several times during the summer months, the fish and crustaceans will swarm the shallow coastline and shore of the bay.

Mobile Bay is the only place on earth where jubilees are a common occurrence.",
            "A riptide is a strong, offshore current that is caused by the tide pulling water through an inlet along a barrier beach.  It is a strong tidal flow of water within estuaries and other enclosed tidal areas.  They become the strongest where the flow is constricted.  When there is a falling or ebbing tide, the water is strongly flowing through an inlet toward the ocean, especially once stabilized by jetties.  During these falling and ebbing tides, a riptide can carry a person far offshore.  For example, the ebbing tide at Shinnecock Inlet in Southampton New York, extends more than 300 m offshore.  Because of this, riptides are typically more powerful than rip currents.  During slack tide, the water is motionless for a short period of time until the flooding or rising tide starts pushing the sea water landward through the inlet.  Riptides also occur in constricted areas in bays and lagoons where there are no waves.  These strong, reversing currents can also be termed ebb jets, flood jet, or tidal jets by coastal engineers because they carry large quantities of sand that form sand bars far out in the ocean and in the bay opposite the inlet channel.  The term \"ebb jet\" would be used for a tidal current leaving an enclosed tidal area, and \"flood jet\" for the equivalent tidal current entering it."

The Taylor microscale is the intermediate length scale at which fluid viscosity significantly affects the dynamics of turbulent eddies in the flow.  This length scale is traditionally applied to turbulent flow which can be characterized by a Kolmogorov spectrum of velocity fluctuations.  In such a flow, length scales which are larger than the Taylor microscale are not strongly affected by viscosity.  These larger length scales in the flow are generally referred to as the inertial range.  Below the Taylor microscale the turbulent motions are subject to strong viscous forces and kinetic energy is dissipated into heat.  These shorter length scale motions are generally termed the dissipation range."

            "The Regional Mexican Albums is a genre-specific record chart published weekly by \"Billboard\" magazine in the United States.  The chart was established in June 1985 and originally listed the top twenty-five best-selling albums of mariachi, tejano, norte\u00f1o, banda and duranguense, which are frequently considered regional Mexican.  The genre is considered by musicologist as being \"the biggest-selling Latin music genre in the United States\", and represented the fastest ever growing Latin genre in the United States after tejano music entered the mainstream market during its 1990s golden age.  Originally, \"Billboard\" based their methodology on sales surveys it sent out to record stores across the United States and by 1991 began monitoring point-of-sales compiled from Nielsen Soundscan.  Musicologist and critics have since criticized the sales data compiled from Nielsen, finding that the company only provides sales from larger music chains than from small shops that specialized in Latin music\u2014where the majority of Latin music sales are generated.  The magazine decided to rank Latin music recordings in August 1970 under the title Hot Latin LPs, which only ranked the best-selling Latin albums in Los Angeles (Pop) and the East Coast (Salsa).  Before the chart's inception, musicians' only chart success was the Texas Latin LPs (formerly the San Antonio Latin LPs) section where regional Mexican music was more prominent.  Beginning in November 1993, \"Billboard\" lowered the rankings from twenty-five to fifteen positions on its Latin genre-specific charts, while the Top Latin Albums expanded to fifty titles.

Occasionally, the support structure may be made out of a steel lattice or truss, but the ride remains classified as a wooden roller coaster due to the track design.  Because of the limits of wood, wooden roller coasters, in general, do not have inversions (when the coaster goes upside down), steep drops, or extremely banked turns (overbanked turns).  However, there are exceptions; the defunct Son of Beast at Kings Island had a 214 ft drop and originally had a 90 ft loop until the end of the 2006 season, although the loop had steel supports.  Other special cases are Hades 360 at Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin.  The coaster features a double-track tunnel, a corkscrew, and a 90-degree banked turn.  There is also The Voyage at Holiday World (an example of a wooden roller coaster with a steel structure for supports) featuring three separate 90-degree banked turns.

The track work is characterised by many turns and \"bunny hops\", the latter producing abrupt negative vertical G forces.  When approaching a turn from a straight section the intended impression is that one will simply continue straight, and thus plunge off of the device, this since there are no transition sections as are in a conventional high speed coaster track and the turn itself is obscured upon close approach.  Almost all Wild Mice feature \"switchback\" sections, consisting of several of these unbanked turns, separated by straight sections.  Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180\u00b0, but some coasters feature 90\u00b0 turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops (for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan, which is no longer operating).

Early forms of inversions, dating as far back as 1848 on the Centrifugal Railway in Paris, were vertical loops that were circular in nature.  They produced massive g-force that was often dangerous to riders, and as a result, the element eventually became non-existent with the last rides to feature the looping inversions being dismantled during the Great Depression.  In 1975, designers from Arrow Development created the corkscrew, reviving interest in the inversion during the modern age of steel roller coasters.

Recording the album was problematic and spanned an entire year: Phil Spector produced sessions in October 1973 at A&M Studios, and Lennon produced sessions in October 1974 at Record Plant Studios (East).  Lennon was being sued by Morris Levy over copyright infringement of one line in his song \"Come Together\".

Spector disappeared with the session recordings and was subsequently involved in a motor accident, leaving the album's tracks unrecoverable until the beginning of the \"Walls and Bridges\" sessions.

            "The .260 Remington (also known as 6.5-08 A-Square) cartridge was introduced by Remington in 1997.  Many wildcat cartridges based on the .308 Winchester case had existed for years before Remington standardized this round.  Although loaded to higher pressures, the ballistics of this cartridge are basically similar to the 6.5\u00d755mm when bullet weights do not exceed 140 grains.  When loaded with heavier bullets, the 6.5\u00d755mm is capable of greater velocity.  Due to its shorter overall length the .260 Remington can be chambered in a shorter length action than the 6.5\u00d755mm.",
            "The .264 Winchester Magnum is a belted, bottlenecked rifle cartridge.  Apart from the .244 H&H Magnum and .257 Weatherby Magnum, it is the smallest caliber factory cartridge derived from the 2.85 in Holland & Holland belted magnum case.  It was introduced in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the .338 Winchester Magnum and the .458 Winchester Magnum as one of a family of short-cased 2.5 in belted magnum cartridges developed by Winchester based on the .375 Holland & Holland parent case.  It was officially introduced to the public by Winchester in 1959.  After many years of dwindling use it began enjoying a mild resurgence in popularity in the mid-2000s among long range rifle enthusiasts and reloaders due to the high ballistic coefficient of the heavier 6.5mm bullets and increasing popularity of cartridges such as 6.5mm Creedmoor, .260 Remington, 6.5 Grendel, benchrest and wildcat cartridges in 6.5mm.",
            "The .404 Jeffery is a large-caliber, rimless cartridge designed for large, dangerous game, such as the \"Big Five\" (elephant, rhino, cape buffalo, lion and leopard) of Africa.  Other names for this cartridge include .404 Jeffery Rimless, .404 Rimless Nitro Express, and 10.75\u00d7 73mm.  It was created by W.J. Jeffery & Co of England based on their desire to duplicate performance of the .450/400 (3\u00bc\") cartridge.  There are two basically similar sets of dimensions for this case, depending on the manufacturer.  The .404 Jeffery as originally loaded fired a .423\" diameter bullet of either 300 gr with a muzzle velocity of 2600 ft/s and muzzle energy of 4500 ft.lbf or 400 gr with a muzzle velocity of 2125 ft/s and 4020 ft.lbf of energy.  It is very effective on large game and is favored by many hunters of dangerous game.  Performance and recoil are similar to other African dangerous game cartridges.  The .404 Jeffery was popular with hunters and game wardens in Africa because it gave good performance with a manageable level of recoil.  By way of comparison, the .416 Rigby and .416 Remington Magnum both fire a 400 grain .416\u00a0in bullet at 2400 ft/s with a muzzle energy of approximately 5000 ft.lbf , which handily exceeds the ballistic performance of the .404 Jeffery but at the price of greater recoil and, in the case of the .416 Rigby, rifles that are significantly more expensive.",

Other, less common names are 6.5\u00d755mm Swedish Mauser, 6.5\u00d755mm Mauser and 6.5\u00d755mm Krag.  It was developed in 1891 for use in the new service rifles then under consideration by the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway.  The two nations had independent armies and consequently the normal procedure at the time was for their respective governments to use the same ammunition and then purchase small arms of their choice.  Norway adopted the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifle, while Sweden adopted a Mauser rifle design.",
            "A lawyer and firearm enthusiast, Charles (Chas.)  Newton's experiments with cartridge design led to the creation of the .22 Savage Hi-Power rifle cartridge which was adopted by the Savage Arms Corporation as a commercial firearm cartridge.  This success was soon followed by the design of the .250-3000 Savage.  At this period in time, Charles also experimented with wildcats based on the .30-06 Springfield case, most notably creating a forerunner of the .25-06 Remington.  This cartridge was first introduced as the .25 Newton Special.  There were probably no firearms produced in this caliber by Netwon.  It soon evolved into the .256 Newton designed to use, at first, a 123 grain bullet followed by later upgrades to 129 grain and 140 grain bullets.  Newton's premise was to use a large case for each caliber he developed in order for the larger powder charge to propel the bullet at high velocity resulting in effective terminal ballistics.  Newton developed several calibers.  The best known are the .22 Newton (90 grain bullet), .256 Newton, .30 Newton (180 grain bullet), .33 Newton (200 grain bullet), .35 Newton (250 grain bullet) and .40 Newton (300 grain bullet).  From 1914 until the late 1920s, he entered into various endeavours to promote and sell rifles in his proprietary calibers.",

As these names would suggest, it is the .308 Winchester case necked down to accept 7 mm (.284) bullets with a small increase in case length.  Of cartridges based upon the .308, it is the second most popular behind only the .243 Winchester.  However, the .308 is more popular than both.  In 1980, the Remington Arms company popularized the cartridge by applying its own name and offering it as a chambering for their Model 788 and Model 700 rifles."

This breed is NOT recognized by the American Kennel Club.  The chizer has a combination of looks from both breeds of dogs, and can vary depending upon the breakdown of the breed.  General sizes of a chizer range between 6-14 inches in height and approximately 4-15-lbs in weight.  The chizer is a small breed dog, and works great in smaller areas, such as apartments, condos, and townhomes.  The chizer comes in a typical variety of colours, usually grey, black, brown or white.  This breed has a smooth, short haired coat that needs constant grooming, trimming around the eyes, ears and nose.  They are usually low to average shedding dogs, and typically most groomers leave their facial hair to mimic a schnauzer beard.  The ears of a chizer are medium in length and can stand erect when at attention, and their tail is usually docked.  The chizer can have either an apple shaped head, or round head, with either a long or short snout, giving it either the appearance of a Chihuahua or Miniature Schnauzer.  The body of the chizer is generally long and lean, with slender legs, and a square, robust back end.

The play describes the mental pain of Karna on the previous day of the Kurukshetra War.  Karnabharam is essentially the retelling of an episode of the Indian epic Mahabharata but the story is presented in a different perspective in the play.  It is perhaps the only potential tragedy in the classic Sanskrit literature, presented in a form that comes closest to the \"Vyayoga\" (Sanskrit: \u0935\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f\u094b\u0917) form of one-act play.  That is so perhaps because the Natya Shastra ordains the playwrights to create plays for recreation, and essentially create happy endings .  In Karnabharam, the tragedy does not occur on-stage (Unlike Urubhanga, a tragedy that shows Duryodhana dying - again, written by Bhasa).  Karnabharam shows the valiant, generous, righteous Karna riding out towards the battle-ground, where his death under heart-wrenching circumstances is certain.

Thigh highs are held up by one or more bands sewn to the top that is backed with silicone on its inner surface.  This ensures the thigh highs stay in position because of the elastic and the friction of the silicone against the skin.  The silicone can become ineffective by contact with body lotions, oils and talcum powder, as they all reduce the friction of the silicone.  Thigh highs are designed so that the elastic band exerts just the right pressure on a woman's thigh, avoiding any uncomfortable tightness or unflattering muffin-top effect.  Sometimes thigh highs are preferred to pantyhose for hygiene reasons, because they reduce excessive microbial growth around the groin due to humidity and warmth."

The present city was founded on 26 February 1411 and announced as the capital on 4 March 1411 by Ahmed Shah I of Gujarat Sultanate as a new capital.  Under the rule of sultanate (1411\u20131511) the city prospered followed by decline (1511\u20131572) when the capital was transferred to Champaner.  For next 135 years (1572-1707), the city renewed greatness under the early rulers of Mughal Empire.  The city suffered due to political instability (1707-1817) under late Mughal rulers followed by joint rule between Maratha and Mughal.  The city further suffered following joint Maratha rule.  The city again progressed when politically stabilized when British East India Company established the rule in the city (1818-1857).  The city further renewed growth when it gain political freedom by establishment of municipality and opening of railway under British crown rule (1857\u20131947).

It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and east.  The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region, and was contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858.  On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities formally to have ended until 8 July 1859.

Bengal Jute was taken to Europe early in the 17th century by the Dutch and the French and later by the East India Company to Britain.  By the 1790s a much larger trade had developed in the Scottish city of Dundee, the European home of jute spinners.  Introduced to the British by the East India Company, crude fibre was the bulk still exported from Bengal after 1790, but a thriving trade did not really begin until after 1850 through mechanised processing, to meet rising demand.  Raw jute was imported from Bengal by the British East India Company.  British Jute Barons grew rich processing jute and selling manufactured products made from jute.  Dundee Jute Barons and the British East India Company began to set up jute mills in Bengal and by 1895 jute industries in Bengal overtook the Scottish jute trade.  Many Scots emigrated to Bengal to set up jute factories.  More than a billion jute sandbags were exported from Bengal to the trenches during World War I and even more during WWII and also exported to the Americas, especially the United States southern region to bag cotton and coffee.  It was used in the fishing, construction, art and in the arms industry.  India, China, Thailand, Myanmar also produce Jute in low quantities.  India is one of the largest importers of Jute in South Asia and also produces processed jute products in the world, while Bangladesh is the largest producer and exporter of raw jute.  Therefore, the local price of raw jute in Bangladesh is the international price.  Ironically, the local price of jute goods produced in India set their own price.",

However, Mir Jafar was in conflict with the East India company over too many demands and tried to tie up with the Dutch East India Company.  The British eventually overran the Dutch forces at Chinsura and played a major role in replacing Mir Jafar with Mir Qasim.

Blocking impending French mastery of India, and eventual British expulsion from the continent, Clive improvised a military expedition that ultimately enabled the East India Company to adopt the French strategy of indirect rule via puppet government.

His rule is widely considered the start of British imperialism in India and was a key step in the eventual British domination of vast areas of the subcontinent.  Siraj ud-Daulah, the previous Nawab of Bengal along with his army were defeated and killed in the Battle of Plassey by the British due to the betrayal of the commander of Siraj ud-Daulah\u2032s army, Mir Jafar, who betrayed Siraj ud-Daulah to become the next Nawab.  Thus after helping the British defeat Siraj ud-Daulah he became the new Nawab of Bengal in 1757 with military support from the British East India Company as a reward for his betrayal.  However, Jafar failed to satisfy constant British demands for money.  In 1758, Robert Clive discovered that through his agent Khoja Wajid, Jafar had made a treaty with the Dutch at Chinsurah.  Dutch ships of war were also seen in the River Hooghly.  Circumstances led to the Battle of Chinsurah.  British company official Henry Vansittart proposed that since Jafar was unable to cope with the difficulties, Mir Qasim, Jafar's son-in-law, should act as Deputy Subahdar.  In October 1760, the company forced him to abdicate in favor of Qasim.  However, Qasim's independent spirit and plan to force the East India company out of his dominion led to his overthrow, and Jafar was restored as the Nawab in 1763 with the support of the company.  Mir Qasim however refused to accept this and went to war against the company.  Jafar ruled until his death on 17 January 1765 and lies buried at the Jafarganj Cemetery in Murshidabad, West Bengal, India.",

            "The Carnatic Wars (also spelled Karnatic Wars) were a series of military conflicts in the middle of the 18th century in India.  The conflicts involved numerous nominally independent rulers and their vassals, struggles for succession and territory, and included a diplomatic and military struggle between the French East India Company and the British East India Company.  They were mainly fought on the territories in India which were dominated by the Nizam of Hyderabad up to the Godavari delta.  As a result of these military contests, the British East India Company established its dominance among the European trading companies within India.  The French company was pushed to a corner and was confined primarily to Pondich\u00e9ry.  The East India company's dominance eventually led to control by the British Company over most of India and eventually to the establishment of the British Raj."

When Canada declared war against Germany in September 1939 the command consisted of only five squadrons.  Four of them equipped with obsolete aircraft including a bomber squadron with aircraft from the Great War and there were no fighter aircraft at all for its only fighter squadron (113 Fighter Squadron was thus disbanded).  With the Japanese threat after Pearl Harbor it grew rapidly and played a critical role in fighter and anti-submarine operations in Canadian and American waters during the Aleutian Islands Campaign.  It was there that Squadron Leader K.A. Boomer of No. 111 Squadron shot down a Rufe fighter, the RCAF's only kill in the Pacific Theatre.  On 7 July 1942 a Bristol Bolingbroke pressed home an attack on the Japanese Submarine Ro 32 the pilot F/Sgt.  P.M.G. Thomas of No. 115 Squadron RCAF then led American Destroyers to sink the damaged submarine.  By January 1943 Western Air Command had expanded to include many bomber, fighter and operational units under its control.  By the end of the war the command would involve some twenty squadrons when the last units to join were added in 1943.  These were the 163 Army Cooperation Squadron in March flying Bristol Bolingbrokes and Hawker Hurricanes, in May the 160 Bomber-Reconnaissance Squadron was added flying Cansos from Sea Island BC (before moving to Yarmouth NS in July) and the 166 Communication Squadron formed in September flying various types.  In addition to the new squadrons, new aircraft types came on line replacing the command's remaining Supermarine Stranraers and Blackburn Sharks with Canso's and the Bolingbrokes and Beauforts with the Lockheed Ventura.  Countless training missions and operational patrols bolstered the air activity over the coastal areas but there was not much action until RCAF Western Command was on the look out for General Kusaba's Fire Balloons that the Japanese called the F\u016bsen Bakudan Campaign.

With the end of the war in Europe these aircraft were joined by a number of Victory Aircraft Lancaster X bombers which were to be used to train the British Commonwealth's Very Long Range Bomber Tiger Force that would soon be sent to bomb the Japanese mainland from Okinawa.

During his time as Chief he continuously supported the strategic bombing offensive against Germany, and advocated the formation of the Pathfinder Force, critical to improving the destructive force of Bomber Command.

Art of the AIDS crisis typically sought to: make a sociopolitical statement, stress the medical impact of the disease, or express feelings of longing and loss.  These ideologies were present in conceptions of art in the 1980s, but are pertinent to reception of art today as well.  More specifically, Elizabeth Taylor spoke at a benefit for AIDS involving artwork, emphasizing its importance to activism in that, \"art lives on forever.\"  This comment articulates the ability of artwork from this time to teach and impact contemporary audiences, post-crisis.

He served as the 28th Governor of Ohio and as United States Secretary of the Interior.  As Governor of Ohio, Cox sided for a time with President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction plan and was against African American suffrage in the South, though he supported it in Ohio.  Seeing himself caught between Johnson and the Radical Republicans, Cox decided not to run for reelection.  He stayed out of politics for a year, though both Sherman and Grant advocated that Cox replace Stanton as Secretary of War as a means of stemming the demands for Johnson's impeachment.  But Johnson declined.  When Ulysses S. Grant became President he nominated Cox Secretary of Interior and Cox immediately accepted.  Secretary of Interior Cox implemented the first civil service reform in a federal government department, including examinations for most clerks.  Grant initially supported Cox and civil service reform, creating America's first Civil Service Commission.  However, Cox was opposed by Republican Party managers, who ultimately convinced Grant to cease civil service reforms.  President Grant and Secretary Cox were at odds over the fraudulent McGarahan Claims and the Dominican Republic annexation treaty.  Secretary Cox advocated a lasting, honest, and comprehensive Indian policy legislated by Congress after the Piegan Indian massacre.  Cox resigned as Secretary of Interior having been unable to gain Grant's support over civil service reform.  Although Cox was a reformer, Grant had believed Cox had overstepped his authority as Secretary of Interior and had undermined his authority as President.  In 1872 Cox joined the Liberal Republicans in opposition to Grant's renomination.  In 1876 Cox returned to politics and was elected to and served one term as United States Congressman of Ohio.  Congressman Cox supported President Hayes's reform efforts, but his term as Congressman was unsuccessful at establishing permanent Civil Service reform.

The breed was selectively bred for its unique features in the cold mountains of Afghanistan.  Its local name is T\u0101\u017e\u012b Spay (Pashto: \u062a\u0627\u0698\u064a \u0633\u067e\u06cc\u200e ) or Sag-e T\u0101z\u012b (Dari Persian: \u0633\u06af \u062a\u0627\u0632\u06cc).

Charles first became involved with dogs when he began to work at Spratt's, a manufacturer of dog biscuits.  He rose to the position of general manager, and whilst working for Spratt's in France he was invited to run his first dog show at the 1878 Exposition Universelle.  After running dog shows in London for four years, he ran his first Cruft's dog show in 1891, and continued to run a further 45 shows until his death in 1938, as well as running two cat shows in 1894 and 1895.  He was involved in a range of dog breed clubs, including that for Schipperkes, Pugs and Borzois.  He and his wife upheld a story that they never owned a dog, and instead owned a cat, however Cruft admitted to owning at least one Saint Bernard in his memoirs, published posthumously.",
            "The Halls Heeler was a dog bred by Thomas Simpson Hall to herd cattle on the Hall family's extensive properties in north-western New South Wales in the 19th century.  On \"Dartbrook Station\", in the Upper Hunter Valley, Hall selectively crossed the offspring of Northumberland Drover's Dogs (Border Collie lineage) that he had imported, with progeny of dingoes that he had tamed.  By 1840 he had bred the type of dog that he needed to control cattle on the massive runs that his family owned, and until he died in 1870 few of these dogs were owned and used by anyone outside the Hall family and their workers.  However the death of Thomas Hall and the break-up of the Hall estate coincided with the development of the dog show, and an interest in breeding dogs to specific criteria or standards.  The Halls Heeler was further developed into two contemporary dog breeds the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog.  The name is spelled both with the possessive apostrophe, as Hall's Heeler, and without.",

            "Bakhmull is an Aboriginal Afghan Hound belonging to an ancient group of oriental sighthounds.  The Afghan Royal Family were the only humans who possessed this breed.  The bakhmull tazi (tazi means \" fast running sighthound\" ) is a long haired variety of sighthounds in Afghanistan.  There are two more: Luchak tazi short haired like sloughi and Khalagh tazi with moderate long hair on ears, shoulders, elbows and thighs.Bakhmull tazi has developed in the mountain areas of Mid and Central Asia - ancient Punjab, Paunchala, \"Five river land\".  This dog breed roots back presumably in the ancient Indian Harappa( Mohenjo Daro) civilization 2300 - 1700 B.C.  If translated from Pashto (Afghan) the word \"bakhmull\" means \"velvet\" due to its incredible silky velvet, long, ivory color hair of the coat, rather abundant and long on the whole body, because it is a mountain oriental sighthound, except the \"saddle\", front parts of four legs and the muzzle.  Its color is always fawn, ivory or white with a darker \"saddle\", thus it produces an impression of a fawn (yellowish) dog which coat color is protective khaki that matches sandstone and limestone of the Hindu Kush mountain landscape and deserts.  Following colors are not permissible: red, red with white spots, black and black with white spots.  Bakhmulls hunt the wild ram, ibex (wild mountain goat), hare, fox, wolf, jackal, wild big cats, in old times leopard, but never birds.  They are also good guards; they guard homes and flocks of sheep.  They hunt solo, in couples and rarely in packs.  Since the 1980s the centre of Bakhmull breeding is in Russia, \"The Blue Dale el Bark Bakhmull\" Moscow, where they are spread all over the former Soviet Republics and various regions.  The foundation stock was brought to Russia in the 70s by military men from Afghanistan.  Breed Standard for tazi BAKHMULL (aboriginal Afghan Hound) was adopted in Moscow, Russia (since Russia has become the 2nd motherland of bakhmulls) first in 1985 and later after detailed elaboration in 1997 (RFOS-RKF).",

            "Liquified flows and fluidized flows are types of sediment-gravity flows in which grains within the flow are kept suspension by the upward movement of fluid.  They form in granular substances where the concentration of suspended mud is too low to develop cohesive forces within the flow.  As grains at the base of the suspension settle out, fluid that is displaced upward by the settling generates pore fluid pressures that can help suspend grains in the upper part of the flow.  Application of an external pressure to the suspension will initiate flow.  This external pressure can be applied by a seismic shock, which may turn transform loose sand into a highly viscous suspension as in quicksand.  Generally as soon as the flow begins to move, fluid turbulence results and the flow rapidly evolves into a turbidity current.  Flows and suspensions are said to be liquefied when the grains settle downward through the fluid and displace the fluid upwards.  By contrast, flows and suspensions are said to fluidized when the fluid moves upward through the grains, thereby temporarily suspending them.  Most flows are liquefied, and many references to fluidized sediment gravity flows are in fact incorrect and actually refer to liquified flows.  Because fluid is displaced upward in these types of flows, dewatering features such as dish structures, pillars, pipes and dikes are common.",
            "A geostrophic current is an oceanic flow in which the pressure gradient force is balanced by the Coriolis effect.  The direction of geostrophic flow is parallel to the isobars, with the high pressure to the right of the flow in the Northern Hemisphere, and the high pressure to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.  This concept is familiar from weather maps, whose isobars show the direction of geostrophic flow in the atmosphere.  Geostrophic flow may be either barotropic or baroclinic.  A geostrophic current may also be thought of as a rotating shallow water wave with a frequency of zero.  The principle of geostrophy is useful to oceanographers because it allows them to infer ocean currents from measurements of the sea surface height (by combined satellite altimetry and gravimetry) or from vertical profiles of seawater density taken by ships or autonomous buoys.  The major currents of the world's oceans, such as the Gulf Stream, the Kuroshio Current, the Agulhas Current, and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, are all approximately in geostrophic balance and are examples of geostrophic currents.",
            "An antidune is a bedform found in fluvial and other channeled environments.  Antidunes occur in supercritical flow, meaning that the Froude number is greater than 1.0 or the flow velocity exceeds the wave velocity; this is also known as upper flow regime.  In antidunes, sediment is deposited on the upstream (stoss) side and eroded from the downstream (lee) side, opposite lower flow regime bedforms.  As a result, antidunes migrate in an upstream direction, counter to the current flow.  Antidunes are called in-phase bedforms, meaning that the water surface elevation mimics the bed elevation; this is due to the supercritical flow regime.  Antidune bedforms evolve rapidly, growing in amplitude as they migrate upstream.  The resultant wave at the water's surface also increases in amplitude.  When that wave becomes unstable, breaks and washes downstream, much of the antidune bedform may be destroyed.",
            "The East Australian Current (EAC) is the southward western boundary current that is formed from the South Equatorial Current (SEC) crossing the Coral Sea and reaching the eastern coast of Australia.  At around 15\u00b0 S near the Australian coast the SEC divides forming the southward flow of the EAC.  It is the largest ocean current close to the shores of Australia.  The EAC reaches a maximum velocity at 30\u00b0 S where its flow can reach 90\u00a0cm/s.  As it flows southward it splits from the coast at around 31\u00b0 to 32\u00b0 S. By the time it reaches 33\u00b0 S it begins to undergo a southward meander while another portion of the transport turns back northward in a tight recirculation.  At this location the EAC reaches its maximum transport of nearly 35\u00a0Sv.  The majority of the EAC flow that does not recirculate will move eastward into the Tasman Front crossing the Tasman Sea just north of the cape of New Zealand.  The remaining will flow south on the EAC Extension until it reaches the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.  The Tasman Front transport is estimated at 13\u00a0Sv.  The eastward movement of the EAC through the Tasman Front and reattaching to the coastline of New Zealand forms the East Auckland Current.  The EAC also acts to transport tropical marine fauna to habitats in sub-tropical regions along the south east Australian coast.",

            "A turbidity current is most typically an underwater current of usually rapidly moving, sediment-laden water moving down a slope.  Turbidity currents can also occur in other fluids besides water.  In the most typical case of oceanic turbidity currents, sediment laden waters situated over sloping ground will flow down-hill because they have a higher density than the adjacent waters.  The driving force behind a turbidity current is gravity acting on the high density of the sediments temporarily suspended within a fluid.  These semi-suspended solids make the average density of the sediment bearing water greater than that of the surrounding, undisturbed water.  As such currents flow, they often have a \"snow-balling-effect\", as they stir up the ground over which they flow, and gather even more sedimentary particles in their current.  Their passage leaves the ground over which they flow scoured and eroded.  Once an oceanic turbidity current reaches the calmer waters of the flatter area of the abyssal plain (main oceanic floor), the particles borne by the current settle out of the water column.  The sedimentary deposit of a turbidity current is called a turbidite.",
            "A reservoir capacitor is a capacitor that is used to smooth the pulsating DC from an AC rectifier.  The reservoir capacitor releases its stored energy during the part of the AC cycle when the AC source does not supply any power, that is, when the AC source changes its phase resulting in change in 'direction of flow of current'.  The change in 'direction of flow of current' of the AC source takes a very small amount of time.  In this short gap of time, the continuous flow of current gradually moves to the state when it ceases.  Using a reservoir capacitor, we fill this gap; since the capacitor releases its stored energy (gets discharged) in that gap of time.  This allows the load to be powered at all times without any interruption.",
            "Electrical polarity (positive and negative) is the direction of current flow in an electrical circuit.  Current flows from the positive pole (terminal) to the negative pole.  Electrons flow from negative to positive.  In a direct current (DC) circuit, current flows in one direction only, and one pole is always negative and the other pole is always positive.  In an alternating current (AC) circuit the two poles alternate between negative and positive and the direction of the current (electron flow) reverses periodically.",
            "Direct current (DC) is the unidirectional flow of electric charge.  A battery is a good example of a DC power supply.  Direct current may flow in a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams.  The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC).  A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current."

There are 11 huy\u1ec7n (Counties or Districts) in the Binh Dinh Region that practices martial arts with villages and cities within each counties that contain style ranging anywhere from 100 to 600 years old.  Counties in the B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh Province include Ph\u00f9 M\u1ef9, Huy\u1ec7n Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t, huy\u1ec7n T\u00e2y S\u01a1n, huy\u1ec7n An L\u00e3o,huy\u1ec7n Ho\u00e0i Nh\u01a1n, Ho\u00e0i \u00c2n, Huy\u1ec7n V\u0129nh Th\u1ea1nh , huy\u1ec7n V\u00e2n Canh, Quy Nh\u01a1n, Tuy Ph\u01b0\u1edbc, and An Nh\u01a1n.

Thu\u1eadn Truy\u1ec1n Village and An Vinh Village style of V\u00f5 B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh is often considered as V\u00f5 T\u00e2y S\u01a1n or also called V\u00f5 c\u1ed5 truy\u1ec1n meaning Traditional Vietnamese Martial Arts and in the eastern district An Nh\u01a1n is An Th\u00e1i style which is considered V\u00f5 T\u00e0u or Chinese Martial Arts.  There is an old saying in the Binh Dinh Region which goes \"Roi Thu\u1eadn Truy\u1ec1n, Quy\u1ec1n An Vinh\" which means the Thu\u1eadn Truy\u1ec1n Quy\u1ec1n village is famous for Staff Techniques and An Vinh Village is famous for empty hand forms.  An Th\u00e1i village is also famous empty hand forms along with its various Chinese Martial Arts that is influenced into Vietnamese martial arts.  Another saying in the Binh Dinh Province is \"Trai An Th\u00e1i, g\u00e1i An Vinh\" meaning that males practice An Th\u00e1i style and females practice An Vinh style.  The reason for this saying is because the An Th\u00e1i style utilizes more power in the empty hand forms making it more suitable when performed by a male.  Vietnamese people are typically smaller in stature and the An Vinh style assumes that the opponent is not Vietnamese making them possibly taller and stronger.  With a height and strength advantage An Vinh Style utilizes speed to overwhelm their opponents which can be seen in their empty hand forms and is more suited towards female fighters.

Early products included: the GDP/2A Graphics Display processor with high speed vector generator capable of drawing in excess of 50,000 vectors at 60\u00a0Hz refresh rates; a CVD/2 Color Video Display System that displayed a full color raster scanned image with a unique data compression algorithm capable of full frame animation display; ADA-16 Analog to Digital and Digital to Analog converters for high fidelity music and speech research, and a UMB-11 Unibus Monitor that was a low-cost test instrument for PDP-11 series minicomputers.

            "In cinematography, full frame refers to the use of the full film gate at maximum width and height for 35 mm film cameras.  It is sometimes also referred to as silent aperture, full gate, or a number of other similar word combinations.  It is the original gate size pioneered by William Dickson and Thomas Edison in 1892 and first used in the short film \"Blacksmithing Scene\".  Full frame is generally used by all 4-perf films, whether silent, standard 35 (Academy ratio width), or Super 35.  The introduction of Academy ratio in 1932 required that the lens mount needed to be shifted slightly horizontally to re-center the lens at the new center of frame; however, the gate size did not change as the extra negative information would be cropped out by lab processes in post-production.  4-perf Super 35 is nearly identical to the original full frame standard, although the lens mount requires vertical re-centering when common topline extraction is used.  It should also be noted that hard mattes for all common ratios exist and either replace the film gate itself or are inserted within it.  However, these are usually not used in the event that any reframing needs to be done.",

            "The Party Processions Act (\"13 & 14 Vict c2\") was an 1850 Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom which prohibited open marching, organised parades and sectarian meetings in Ireland in order to outlaw provocative movements in the wake of the Dolly's Brae fighting of 1849.  Written on 8 February, the Act was assembled against people \"in the practice of assembling and marching together in procession in Ireland in a manner calculated to create and perpetuate animosities between different classes of Her Majesty's Subjects, and to endanger the public peace.\"  Actions such as using banners, emblems and flags constituted an offence, as did music \"calculated or tend to provoke animosity\".  Violation of the Act was classed as a misdemeanor.  The Act was strongly supported by Sir Robert Peel however opposed by other politicians such as Lord Claude Hamilton who argued that religious parades would also be outlawed, yet posed no threat.  The \"Party Emblems Act\" was passed in 1860 to further support this measure following further riots at Derrymacash.  The Act was \"grudgingly\" accepted by the Orangemen, however both the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the Young Ireland movement, and related Fenian movements were less placated.  William Johnston of Ballykilbeg led a radical Orangemen group in defiance of the act during the 1860s, and was imprisoned \u2013 prompting strong demand for its repeal in 1867, which succeeded in 1872.  The issue and repeal of the Act is viewed as an important milestone by nationalist historians of Ireland, and is said to be an example of Irish suppression by the \"English\" government.  Peel, however, was one of a number of Members of Parliament who viewed the Act as a necessity to prevent Catholic and Protestant in-fighting rather than Irish nationalism as a whole.  Traditional, revisionist and post-revisionist historians have subsequently supported either viewpoint and the Act remains a controversial one.",
