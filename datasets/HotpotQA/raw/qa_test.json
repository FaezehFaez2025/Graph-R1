Handel used the libretto of \"L'isola di Alcina\", an opera that was set in 1728 in Rome by Riccardo Broschi, which he acquired the year after during his travels in Italy.  Partly altered for better conformity, the story was originally taken from Ludovico Ariosto's \"Orlando furioso\" (like those of the Handel operas \"Orlando\" and \"Ariodante\"), an epic poem.

His voice was \"heroic ... with a baritonal quality, ... yet Verdi and Donizetti appreciated his ability to sing softly and with subtlety.\"  An Italian biographer has pointed out Fraschini's role in extending the longevity of Donizetti's operas, while at the same time accelerating the ascent of Verdi's repertory.  He was indeed the most prominent singer who facilitated the transition from Donizetti to Verdi.  Fraschini sang over one hundred roles and Verdi placed him at the top of his favorite tenors' list and described him as a \"natural Manrico\" for his \"Il trovatore\".  Fraschini also played a pivotal role in the success of many operas by Pacini and Mercadante.",

            "Beer in Mexico has a long history.  While Mesoamerican cultures knew of fermented alcoholic beverages, including a corn beer, long before the Spanish conquest, European style beer brewed with barley was introduced with the Spanish soon after Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s\u2019s arrival.  Production of this beer here was limited during the colonial period due to the lack of materials and severe restrictions and taxes placed on the product by Spanish authorities.  After the Mexican War of Independence, these restrictions disappeared, and the industry was permitted to develop.  Furthermore, the arrival of German immigrants and the short-lived empire of Austrian Maximilian I in the 19th century provided the impetus for the opening of many breweries in various parts of the country.  By 1918, there were 36 brewing companies, but over the 20th century, the industry consolidated until today, only two corporations, Grupo Modelo and FEMSA control 90% of the Mexican beer market.

Gluck struck a nerve in French sensitivities, and whereas \"Armide\" was not one of his more popular works, it remained a critical touchstone in the French operatic tradition and was warmly praised by Berlioz in his \"Memoirs\".  Gluck also set a minor fashion for resetting Lully/Quinault operas: Gluck's rival Piccinni followed his example with \"Roland\" in 1778 and \"Atys\" in 1780; in the same year, Philidor produced a new \"Pers\u00e9e\"; and Gossec offered his version of \"Th\u00e9s\u00e9e\" in 1782.  Gluck himself is said to have been working on an opera based on \"Roland\", but he abandoned it when he heard Piccinni had taken on the same libretto."

The statue of the Saint was commissioned by the cloth merchant's guild, the \"Arte di Calimala\".  The artist's use of the unnaturalistic but elegant curves in the hair and drapery of the saint show the influence of the International Gothic style prevalent in Italy at the time the work was created.  The work was successfully cast in a single piece, making it the first bronze statue of its size to be cast in a single piece for at least several hundred years in Italy.",

This was a time when the Renaissance avant-garde of Sienese painters, headed by Domenico di Bartolo and Lorenzo Vecchietta, were eagerly assimilating the innovations of the leading Florentine artists of the early Renaissance.  Following in the footsteps of the leading Florentine painters and sculptors \u2013 Masaccio, Masolino, Filippo Lippi, Lorenzo Ghiberti and Donatello \u2013 they reformed the traditional formulas of Sienese painting without breaking with their own well-established traditions.  These artists permeated their old Sienese formulas and inventions with a Renaissance spirit and produced pictures of major physical substance, consequently scenes of higher empathy, and, in the case of the splendid frescoes of the Pellegrinaio of the Ospedale di Santa Maria della Scala in Siena, episodes embedded in fantastic architectural settings, constructed as eccentric expressions of the newly acquired rules of perspective within an artistic vocabulary of no lesser eccentricity inspired by the classical world.",

The octagonal brick domical vault was built between 1420 and 1436, with Ghiberti resigning in 1433.  The lantern surmounting the dome, also designed by Brunelleschi, was not begun until 1446, after his death.  It was completed in 1467.  He had also planned for a two-story external gallery and cornice to be built at the top of the drum where a strip of unclad masonry can be seen today.

He is known by Giorgio Vasari as dal Ponte, a name derived from the location of his studio at the Piazza di Santo Stefano a Ponte.  Many other documents cite his name as Giovanni di Marco.  After joining the Arte dei Medici e degli Speziali in 1410 and the Compagnia di S Luca in 1413, dal Ponte opened his studio in the late 1420s and hired Florentine painter Smeraldo di Giovanni as his assistant.  Smeraldo was hired after dal Ponte was imprisoned in 1424 due to failure to repay his debts, with the intention that Smeraldo would manage the logistical aspects of the workshop in addition to his artwork.  Dal Ponte used his craftsmanship to create not only Panel paintings, but also frescoes and decorations for small objects.  Dal Ponte's work is considered to be of the Late Gothic style, though he assimilated the stylistic preferences of his contemporaries; Lorenzo Monaco, Masaccio, and Lorenzo Ghiberti served as his primary influences.",

            "With the formation of stars, heavier nuclei were created from hydrogen and helium by stellar nucleosynthesis, a process that continues today.  Some of these elements, particularly those lighter than iron, continue to be delivered to the interstellar medium when low mass stars eject their outer envelope before they collapse to form white dwarfs.  The remains of their ejected mass form the planetary nebulae observable throughout our galaxy.",
            "The BFH paper, named after the initials of the authors of the paper, Margaret Burbidge, Geoffrey Burbidge, William Fowler, and Fred Hoyle, is a landmark paper of stellar physics published in \"Reviews of Modern Physics\" in 1957.  The formal title of the paper is \"Synthesis of the Elements in Stars\", but the article is generally referred to only as \"BFH\".",
            "Stellar nucleosynthesis is the process by which the natural abundances of the chemical elements within stars change due to nuclear fusion reactions in the cores and their overlying mantles.  Stars are said to evolve (age) with changes in the abundances of the elements within.  Core fusion increases the atomic weight of elements and reduces the number of particles, which would lead to a pressure loss except that gravitation leads to contraction, an increase of temperature, and a balance of forces.  A star loses most of its mass when it is ejected late in the star's lifetime, thereby increasing the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the interstellar medium.  The term supernova nucleosynthesis is used to describe the creation of elements during the evolution and explosion of a pre-supernova star, a concept put forth by Fred Hoyle in 1954.  A stimulus to the development of the theory of nucleosynthesis was the discovery of variations in the abundances of elements found in the universe.  Those abundances, when plotted on a graph as a function of atomic number of the element, have a jagged sawtooth shape that varies by factors of tens of millions.  This suggested a natural process that is not random.  Such a graph of the abundances can be seen at History of nucleosynthesis theory article.  Of the several processes of nucleosynthesis, stellar nucleosynthesis is the dominating contributor to elemental abundances in the universe.",
            "George Gamow (March 4\u00a0[O.S.

He was an early advocate and developer of Lema\u00eetre's Big Bang theory.  He discovered a theoretical explanation of alpha decay via quantum tunneling, and worked on radioactive decay of the atomic nucleus, star formation, stellar nucleosynthesis and Big Bang nucleosynthesis (which he collectively called nucleocosmogenesis), and molecular genetics.",

            "John Allen \"Jack\" Eddy (March 25, 1931 \u2013 June 10, 2009) was an American astronomer who published professionally under the name John A. Eddy but much of the content referencing him can be found under his nickname Jack which he preferred to use.  In 1976 Dr. Eddy published a landmark paper in Science titled \"The Maunder Minimum\" where, using the Nineteenth Century works of Edward W. Maunder and Gustav Sp\u00f6rer, he identified a 70-year period from 1645 to 1715 as a time when solar activity all but stopped.  In making the case for the anomaly, he gathered and interpreted data from a wide variety of sources, including first-hand accounts from extant historical observations of the Sun going back to the telescopic observations of Galileo and other contemporary scientists of the 17th and early 18th centuries; from historical reports of the aurora borealis observed in past centuries in Europe and the New World; from visual observations of sunspots seen with the unaided eye at sunrise and sunset in dynastic records from the Orient; from existing descriptions of the eclipsed Sun; and from measurements of carbon-14 in dated tree-rings.  In the last of these, which can be used as a proxy indicator of solar activity, he found evidence of other similar periods of solar quiescence in the distant past, the most recent an even longer 90-year span, from about 1460 until 1550, which he named the Sp\u00f6rer Minimum.  Both the Maunder and Sp\u00f6rer minima fell during the coldest parts of the Little Ice Age, which suggested a meaningful connection between the longer term behavior of the Sun and of the Earth\u2019s mean surface temperature.  In advancing the theory that the Sun is a variable star Eddy observed: \"It has long been thought that the Sun is a constant star of regular and repeatable behavior.  Measurements of the radiative output, or solar constant, seem to justify the first assumption, and the record of periodicity in sunspot numbers is taken as evidence of the second.  Both records, however, sample only the most recent history of the Sun.\"",
            "Boron is a chemical element with symbol\u00a0B and atomic number\u00a05.  Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust.  Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals.  These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite.  The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.",
            "Neutron capture nucleosynthesis describes two nucleosynthesis pathways: the r-process and the s-process, for \"rapid\" and \"slow\" neutron captures, respectively.  R-process describes neutron capture in a region of high neutron flux, such as during supernova nucleosynthesis after core-collapse, and yields neutron-rich nuclides.  S-process describes neutron capture that is slow relative to the rate of beta decay, as for stellar nucleosynthesis in some stars, and yields nuclei with stable nuclear shells.  Each process is responsible for roughly half of the observed abundances of elements heavier than iron.  The importance of neutron capture to the observed abundance of the chemical elements was first described in 1957 in the BFH paper.",

A student of European history, he was a leading and pioneering specialist on the study of nationalism.  He was elected as president of the American Historical Association over the opposition of liberals and the more explicit Anti-Catholic bias that defined the academic community of his era.  He served as United States Ambassador to Spain in World War II, but he came under attack from the CIO, communists and other forces on the left that rejected any dealings with the Spain of Francisco Franco.  Historian Holly Cowan Shulman wrote:Hayes, whom President Franklin Roosevelt appointed in March 1942, was a choice necessitated by Spanish politics.  The Franco regime would not have tolerated either a non-Catholic or a liberal.  Hayes was an active Catholic who believed that Franco's government should not be ideologically grouped with the Axis countries.

Under his regime, primary subjects of censorship included public display of liberal political ideology, art forms such as literature and film, as well as symbols of foreign, non-conservative ideologies.  This censorship was primarily driven by Franco's vision for ideological unity in Spain.  As a result, Franco called for the censorship of materials that promoted liberal ideas from abroad, particular those of European origin.  Aside from censorship of foreign ideology, symbols of Spanish identity, such as Catalonia, also became primary targets of censorship.  Under his authoritarian regime, censorship was imposed primarily through systemic political repression.  Franco's regime repressed expression of liberal social and political ideology among the Spanish public."

It marks a highpoint of the late 15th century Ghent-Bruges school of illumination and is now in the Austrian National Library in Vienna (\u00d6sterreichische Nationalbibliothek, Codex Vindobonensis 1897).  It is thought to have been a wedding gift from James IV of Scotland or another Scottish nobleman to James's wife Margaret Tudor on the occasion of their marriage, perhaps finishing a book already started for another purpose.  A number of artists worked on the extensive programme of decoration, so that \"the manuscript in its entirety presents a rather odd picture of heterogeneity\".  The best known miniature, a full-page portrait of James at prayer before an altar with an altarpiece of Christ and an altar frontal with James's coat-of-arms, gave his name to the Master of James IV of Scotland, who is now generally identified as Gerard Horenbout, court painter to Margaret of Austria; he did only one other miniature in the book.  The equivalent image of Margaret is the only image by another artist, using a rather generic face for the queen's portrait, and in a similar style to that of the Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian.  Other artists worked on the other miniatures, which include an unusual series of unpopulated landscapes in the calendar - perhaps the Flemish artists were not sure how Scots should be dressed.",

            "The religious element is difficult to identify in Mycenaean Greece (c. 1600-1100 BC), especially as regards archaeological sites, where it remains problematic to pick out a place of worship with certainty.  John Chadwick points out that at least six centuries lie between the earliest presence of Proto-Greek speakers in Hellas and the earliest inscriptions in the Mycenaean script known as Linear B, during which concepts and practices will have fused with indigenous beliefs, and\u2014if cultural influences in material culture reflect influences in religious beliefs\u2014with Minoan religion.  As for these texts, the few lists of offerings that give names of gods as recipients of goods reveal nothing about religious practices, and there is no surviving literature.  John Chadwick rejected a confusion of Minoan and Mycenaean religion derived from archaeological correlations and cautioned against \"the attempt to uncover the prehistory of classical Greek religion by conjecturing its origins and guessing the meaning of its myths\" above all through treacherous etymologies.  Moses I. Finley detected very few authentic Mycenaean reflections in the eighth-century Homeric world, in spite of its \"Mycenaean\" setting.  However, Nilsson asserts, based not on uncertain etymologies but on religious elements and on the representations and general function of the gods, that a lot of Minoan gods and religious conceptions were fused in the Mycenaean religion.  From the existing evidence, it appears that the Mycenaean religion was the mother of the Greek religion.  The Mycenaean pantheon already included many divinities that can be found in classical Greece.",

It was part of the greatest sanctuary in the Argolid, dedicated to Hera, whose epithet \"Argive Hera\" (\u1f2d\u03c1\u03b7 \u1f08\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03b7 \"Here Argeie\") appears in Homer's works.  Hera herself claims to be the protector of Argos in \"Iliad\" IV, 50\u201352): \"The three towns I love best are Argos, Sparta and Mycenae of the broad streets\".  The memory was preserved at Argos of an archaic, aniconic pillar representation of the Great Goddess.  The site, which might mark the introduction of the cult of Hera in mainland Greece, lies northeast of Argos between the archaeological sites of Mycenae and Midea, two important Mycenaean cities.  The traveller Pausanias, visiting the site in the 2nd century CE, referred to the area as Prosymna (\u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7).",

There, Pausanias noted, was \"a spring called Kanathos where, so say the Argives, Hera bathes every year and, by so doing, becomes a maiden; it is this story which is of the secrets connected with the rites which they perform to Hera.\"  The unspoken nature of the ritual forbade its being embodied openly or directly in Greek mythology.  S. Casson suggested that it was the obscure subject of the so-called \"Ludovisi Throne\", generally considered to represent the parallel, and far better-known, renewal of Aphrodite, bathing in the sea at Paphos.",

Classical Greeks associated such cult objects, whether aniconic or effigy, with the legendary Daedalus.  Many such cult images were preserved into historical times, though none are known to have survived to the modern day, except where their image was copied in stone or marble.  In the 2nd century CE, Pausanias described numerous xoana in his \"Description of Greece\", notably the image of Hera in her temple at Samos.  \"The statue of Samian Hera, as Aethilos [sic!]  says, was a wooden beam at first, but afterwards, when Prokles was ruler, it was humanized in form\".

            "The National Art Museum of Sport (NAMOS) is a fine art museum that focuses on a sport theme.  Sport art captures emotion: the anxiety of competition, the joy of winning, the agony of defeat.  It depicts internal conflict: the pitting of honor and sportsmanship versus the desire to win, or the struggle to maintain resolve in the face of overwhelming odds, pain and fatigue.  Whether one thinks of the athletic contests portrayed in Greek vase painting and sculpture, the epic hunts that form the subjects of so many great medieval tapestries and manuscript pages, or the elegant horse-racing scenes of Fay Moore and Marilyn Newmark, depicting sport has inspired artists particularly those who want to capture the motion and emotion of sport.  In America, a country celebrated for hard work and hard play, sport art has had an especially vigorous history.  Many of the most renowned artists- Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer, and George Bellows-were active sports persons themselves and numbered among their friends leading athletes, fishermen and hunters.  For them, as for many others, the multifaceted drama of sport was both a challenge and inspiration, the generating force that led to unforgettable works.",

Ballet spread from Italy to France with the help of Catherine de' Medici, where ballet developed even further under her aristocratic influence.  An early example of Catherine's development of ballet is through 'Le Paradis d' Amour', a piece of work presented at her daughter's wedding, Marguerite de Valois to Henry of Navarre.  Aristocratic money was responsible for the initial stages of development in 'court ballet', as it was royal money that dictated the ideas, literature and music used in ballets that were created to primarily entertain the aristocrats of the time.  The first formal 'court ballet' ever recognized was staged in 1573, 'Ballet des Polonais'.  In true form of royal entertainment, 'Ballet des Polonais' was commissioned by Catherine de' Medici to honor the Polish ambassadors who were visiting Paris upon the accession of Henry of Anjou to the throne of Poland.  In 1581, Catherine de' Medici commissioned another court ballet, \"Ballet Comique de la Reine\", however it was her compatriot, Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx, who organized the ballet.  Catherine de' Medici and Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx were responsible for presenting the first court ballet ever to apply the principles of Baif's Academie, by integrating poetry, dance, music and set design to convey a unified dramatic storyline.  Moreover, the early organization and development of 'court ballet' was funded by, influenced by and produced by the aristocrats of the time, fulfilling both their personal entertainment and political propaganda needs.",

Such works frequently make use of polychoral techniques and often feature instrumental forces considerably larger than the norm for the Baroque period.  The Colossal Baroque had its roots in Italy, in the resplendent multiple polychoral music of the Venetian School, in the sumptuous, extravagant productions of the Medici court, for example the 40- and 60-voice \"Missa sopra Ecco s\u00ec beato giorno\" by Alessandro Striggio, and in the large polychoral works of the Roman School, many of which were written long after the Venetian School had vanished.  An impetus for this music was the Council of Trent [Counter-Reformation].  Some attendees of the Council held the unofficial point of view that music should be subservient to text, as both exemplified as well as idealized in the choral music of Palestrina.  Some critics held that this was not as achievable in larger choral textures."

From one classic Marxist point of view, the role of art is not only to represent such conditions truthfully, but also to seek to improve them (social/socialist realism); however, this is a contentious interpretation of the limited but significant writing by Marx and Engels on art and especially on aesthetics.

Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as class conflict, and generally contrast historically dominant ideologies.  It is therefore a macro level analysis of society.  Karl Marx is the father of the social conflict theory, which is a component of the four paradigms of sociology.  Certain conflict theories set out to highlight the ideological aspects inherent in traditional thought.  While many of these perspectives hold parallels, conflict theory \"does not\" refer to a unified school of thought, and should not be confused with, for instance, peace and conflict studies, or any other specific theory of social conflict.",
            "K. Ramakrishna Pillai (1878\u20131916) was a nationalist writer, journalist, editor, and political activist.  He edited \"Swadeshabhimani\" (The Patriot), the newspaper which became a potent weapon against the rule of the British and the erstwhile princely state of Travancore (Kerala, India) and a tool for social transformation.  His criticism of the Diwan of Travancore, P. Rajagopalachari and the Maharajah led to the eventual confiscation of the newspaper.  Ramakrishna Pillai was arrested and exiled from Travancore in 1910.  Vrithantha Pathra Pravarthanam (1912) and Karl Marx (1912) are among his most noted works in Malayalam, Vrithantha Pathra pravarthanam being the first book on journalism in Malayalam and Karl Marx, the first ever biography of Karl Marx in any Indian language."

The Earth has two such belts and sometimes others may be temporarily created.  The discovery of the belts is credited to James Van Allen, and as a result the Earth's belts are known as the Van Allen belts.  Earth's two main belts extend from an altitude of about 500 to 58,000 kilometers above the surface in which region radiation levels vary.  Most of the particles that form the belts are thought to come from solar wind and other particles by cosmic rays. By trapping the solar wind, the magnetic field deflects those energetic particles and protects the Earth's atmosphere from destruction.",

Electrons are trapped in the Van Allen radiation belt by Earth's magnetic fields and begin to spiral around field lines in the radiation belt.  They may remain there for an indefinite period of time (in some cases years).  When broadband very low frequency (VLF) waves propagate the radiation belts, the electrons exit the radiation belt and \"precipitate\" (or travel) into the ionosphere (a region of Earth's atmosphere) where the electrons will collide with ions.  Electron precipitation is regularly linked to ozone depletion.  It is often caused by lightning strikes.",
            "Gas-discharge lamps are a family of artificial light sources that generate light by sending an electric discharge through an ionized gas, a plasma.  Typically, such lamps use a noble gas (argon, neon, krypton, and xenon) or a mixture of these gases.  Some include additional substances, like mercury, sodium, and metal halides, which are vaporized during startup to become part of the gas mixture.  In operation, some of the electrons are forced to leave the atoms of the gas near the anode by the electric field applied between the two electrodes, leaving these atoms positively ionized.  The electrons ejected from these atoms flow onto the anode, while the cations thus formed are accelerated by the electric field and flow towards the cathode.  Typically, after traveling a very short distance, the ions collide with neutral gas atoms, which transfer their electrons to the ions.  The atoms, having lost an electron during the collisions, ionize and speed toward the cathode while the ions, having gained an electron during the collisions, return to a lower energy state while releasing energy in the form of photons.  Light of a characteristic frequency is thus emitted.  In this way, electrons are relayed through the gas from the anode to the cathode.  The color of the light produced depends on the emission spectra of the atoms making up the gas, as well as the pressure of the gas, current density, and other variables.  Gas discharge lamps can produce a wide range of colors.  Some lamps produce ultraviolet radiation which is converted to visible light by a fluorescent coating on the inside of the lamp's glass surface.  The fluorescent lamp is perhaps the best known gas-discharge lamp.",

            "Plasma (from Ancient Greek \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 , meaning \"moldable substance\" or \"jelly\") can simply be considered as a gaseous mixture of negatively charged electrons and highly charged positive ions, however, true plasma production is from the distinct separation of these ions and electrons that produces an electric field, which in turn, produces electric currents and magnetic fields. Plasma is one of the four fundamental states of matter and was first introduced by chemist Irving Langmuir in the 1920s.  Unlike, the other three states of solid, liquid, and gas, plasma does not freely exist on the Earth.  Plasma can be generated by heating neutral gases or by subjecting gas to a strong electromagnetic field.",
            "Ionic bonding is a type of chemical bond that involves the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, and is the primary interaction occurring in ionic compounds.  The ions are atoms that have gained one or more electrons (known as anions, which are negatively charged) and atoms that have lost one or more electrons (known as cations, which are positively charged).  This transfer of electrons is known as electrovalence in contrast to covalence.  In the simplest case, the cation is a metal atom and the anion is a nonmetal atom, but these ions can be of a more complex nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH or SO.  In simpler words, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal in order to obtain a full valence shell for both atoms.",
            "A Birkeland current is a set of currents that flow along geomagnetic field lines connecting the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere to the Earth's high latitude ionosphere.  In the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, the currents are driven by the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field and by bulk motions of plasma through the magnetosphere (convection indirectly driven by the interplanetary environment).  The strength of the Birkeland currents changes with activity in the magnetosphere (e.g. during substorms).  Small scale variations in the upward current sheets (downward flowing electrons) accelerate magnetospheric electrons which, when they reach the upper atmosphere, create the Auroras Borealis and Australis.  In the high latitude ionosphere (or auroral zones), the Birkeland currents close through the region of the auroral electrojet, which flows perpendicular to the local magnetic field in the ionosphere.  The Birkeland currents occur in two pairs of field-aligned current sheets.  One pair extends from noon through the dusk sector to the midnight sector.  The other pair extends from noon through the dawn sector to the midnight sector.  The sheet on the high latitude side of the auroral zone is referred to as the Region 1 current sheet and the sheet on the low latitude side is referred to as the Region 2 current sheet.",
            "Electrons play an essential role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions.  Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron is moving relative to an observer it will generate a magnetic field.  Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources (not those self-produced) will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law.  Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated.  Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields.  Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space.  Electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics, welding, cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators.",
            "An astrophysical plasma is a plasma (a highly ionized gas) whose physical properties are studied as part of astrophysics.  Much of the baryonic matter of the universe is thought to consist of plasma, a state of matter in which atoms and molecules are so hot, that they have ionized by breaking up into their constituent parts, negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions. Because the particles are charged, they are strongly influenced by electromagnetic forces, that is, by magnetic and electric fields.  All astrophysical plasmas are likely influenced by magnetic fields.",
            "In plasma physics, waves in plasmas are an interconnected set of particles and fields which propagates in a periodically repeating fashion.  A plasma is a quasineutral, electrically conductive fluid.  In the simplest case, it is composed of electrons and a single species of positive ions, but it may also contain multiple ion species including negative ions as well as neutral particles.  Due to its electrical conductivity, a plasma couples to electric and magnetic fields.  This complex of particles and fields supports a wide variety of wave phenomena."

Occupied by Napoleon from 1808 to 1814, a massively destructive \"war of independence\" ensued, driven by an emergent Spanish nationalism.  An era of reaction against the liberal ideas associated with revolutionary France followed the war, personified by the rule of Ferdinand VII and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 his daughter Isabella II.  Ferdinand's rule included the loss of the Spanish colonies in the New World, except for Cuba and Puerto Rico, in the 1810s and 1820s.  A series of civil wars then broke out in Spain, pitting Spanish liberals and then republicans against conservatives, culminating in the Carlist Wars between the moderate Queen Isabella and her uncle, the reactionary Infante Carlos.  Disaffection with Isabella's government from many quarters led to repeated military intervention in political affairs and to several revolutionary attempts against the government.  Two of these revolutions were successful, the moderate Vicalvarada or \"Vic\u00e1lvaro Revolution\" of 1854 and the more radical \"la Gloriosa\" (Glorious Revolution) in 1868.  The latter marks the end of Isabella's monarchy.
