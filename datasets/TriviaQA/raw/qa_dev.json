The addition of \"\"CHINA\"\" to stamps' inscriptions began in 1992. Western collectors typically differentiate earlier stamps both by the serial numbers in the lower corner, and by the first character of the country name \u4e2d, the \"\"square box with a vertical bar\"\" being visually distinct from the inscription used by any other Asian country.

Semi-postal stamps are usually denominated with two values, with a \"\"+\"\" between, the first indicating the actual rate, and the second the additional amount to be given to a charity. In a very few cases a country has had a dual currency, and the stamps may depict a value in both currencies. The second required element, at least for stamps intended to be used on international mail, is the name of the country. The first postage stamps, those of the United Kingdom, had no name.

Occasionally designs use text as their primary design element; for instance, a series of US stamps from the 1970s featured quotations from the United States Declaration of Independence. In general however, text has come to be used more sparingly in recent years. Countries with multiple languages and multiple scripts may need to write the material multiple times.

To this day the UK remains the only country not required to name itself on its stamps. For all other UPU members, the name must appear in Latin letters. The name chosen is typically the country's own name for itself, with a modern trend towards using simpler and shorter forms, or abbreviations.

Following the introduction of the postage stamp in the UK, prepaid postage considerably increased the number of letters mailed. Before 1839, the number of letters sent in the UK was typically 76 million.
